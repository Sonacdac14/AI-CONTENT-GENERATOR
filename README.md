Then we use haystack document store to import the elastic search engine.
Upload the document directory and use the pretrain model,deepset/roberta-base-squad2.
Accordingly we will give query to the model and it will search in it and provide the correct content of your answer. 
This is the best technique/project through which we can get any type of content from many of the documents.
